# 🏠E Commerse Website

This repository contains a demo e-commerce site designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, where I fetch and display data using a self-created database, there are two pages: the homepage and the cart page. On the homepage, you can add the desired product to your cart, and simultaneously view the added products, their total price, and quantities in the cart. Additionally, on the cart page, you can update the quantities or remove selected products. During all these actions, the total price of the products in the cart is instantly updated based on the changes made.
